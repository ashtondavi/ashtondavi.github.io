## MazingPaints
   
This is the website for an experimental project attempting to blend digital 
painting with "real-life" brush on canvas painting. to do this photos are used 
as the subject of the paintings and computer controlled brushes paint the final 
canvases using different digital methods.
   
The video below shows one example of digital painting. Multiple brush strokes 
and sizes are used to generate a digital image which looks similar to a painting. 
This project takes this a step further and produces a real-life production of 
the digital painting.

## Background to the project...  
   
I started working on this project out of curiosity, some spare time during 
covid-19 lockdown, and wanting to brighten up my house with some more paintings.   
   
I will be updating this website with content as new paintings are completed or 
new and interesting breakthroughs are made on the painting method.   
   
*Hope you enjoy :)*
