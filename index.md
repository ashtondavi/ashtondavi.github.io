# MazingPaints

**Under development: This website and project are a work in progress and to be**
**fair will probably never be complete**

## Where did this come from and what is it?

MazingPaints is a project to blend digitial painting with real-life brush on 
canvas painting. 

I started working on this out of curiosity, a bit of covid-19 lockdown 
boredom, and a desire to spice up my home with a bit of extra color. I am 
unsure if I would call this a tech project or an art project...or if I should 
accept a world without boxes and just call it "a project".   
   
   
## A few details...

The concept for the project is to use photos as templates for digital painting 
followed by conversion of these paintings to real-life using brushes attached
to a modified 3D printer. As you can imagine the path from real-life subject to
finished painting has alot of twists and turns. But lets be honest, thats the
fun part and leaves plenty of room for creativity.
