# Painting styles and methods

## Styles

One of my interests for the project is to explore what styles can be painted 
using computerized brushes. While the technology is limited compared to 
hand painting in some ways, there are other aspects and painting styles that can 
be explored and might be challenging without it. Things that affect the final
painting include choice of template photo, changes in the digitial painting 
software, and the types of brushs and paints used.   

One style that I found early in the project can be seen in the images below. A 
maze-like pattern is generated by some digital methods to fill in the areas of a 
canvas. Using a larger brush this pattern is hidden inside the painting, but by 
using a slightly smaller brush the maze pattern can be seen.

## Colors

One of the challenges with generating paintings using this approach is working 
with colors. Selecting the right color or color combination is one aspect of 
color based painting, but mixing and applying colors with the computerized 
brushes is quite difficult. This is not an issue for digital painting as the 
computer has access to any color combination it would like. I am planning to 
revisit color based painting, but for the moment I have paused exploring this 
aspect of the project.
