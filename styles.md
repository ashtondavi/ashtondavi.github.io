# Painting styles and methods

## Styles

One of my interests for the project is to explore what styles can be painted 
using this combination of technology. While the technology is limited compared 
to human painting in some ways it is able to do other things that humans 
struggle with.

One style that emerged early in the project was the maze like style shown in the 
images blow. A maze-like pattern is generated by the digital methods to fill in 
the areas of a canvas. If a slightly smaller brush is used in real-life then the 
maze pattern can be seen on the final canvas.

## Colors

One of the great challenges with paintings is colors. Colors are technical in a
number of ways including selecting the right color or color combination how to 
mix colors before painting, and how to apply colors on the painting. Mixing and 
applying colors is a particularly challenging aspect for the technology based 
approaches. This is not an issue for digitial painting, but when converting the 
paintings to physical productions a large number of technical challenges are 
introduced. For the minute, I have paused exploring this aspect until some of 
the other painting aspects are solved.
