# Styles

One of my interests for this project is to explore the variety of styles which 
could be painted using this approach. While this is the more artistic aspect of 
the project it is strongly linked with the technical challenges in the project.

One style that has emerged early in this project - and is the inspiration for 
the name - is the *Mazing* style. I think this style captures the mixture of 
the aspects in this project by blending the technical and artistic. Often the
very creative logic used in computers is hidden away for only developers to see, 
but this style provides a glimpse into how the software is attempting to 
carry out the painting process.
