# MazingPaints

## What is this?
   
This is the website for an experimental project blending digital painting with 
"real-life" brush on canvas painting. Template photos are used as the subject of 
the paintings and computer controlled brushes paint the final canvases using
information from a variety of digital methods.   
   
   
## Background to the project...  
   
I started working on this out of curiosity, a bit of covid-19 lockdown boredom, 
and wanting to brighten up my home with some extra color.

The fun part of this project is exploring how the different components of the
project affect the final painting. Many small things can affect this - 
from the choice of template photos, to changes in the digitial painting 
software, or the selection of brush sizes and paint textures.

I will be updating this website with content as new paintings are completed or 
new and interesting breakthroughs are made on the painting method.

*Hope you enjoy :)*
