# MazingPaints

## What is this?
   
This is the website for an experimental project attempting to blend digital 
painting with "real-life" brush on canvas painting. Template photos are used as 
the subject of the paintings and computer controlled brushes paint the final 
canvases using information from a variety of digital methods.   
   
The video below shows one example of a digital method, which can be used to 
generate a digital painting from an input image. Multiple brush sizes and 
strokes and are used to generate a digital image that looks like a painting. 
This project takes this a method a step further and use the information 
generated to produce a real-life production of the painting.

## Background to the project...  
   
I started working on this project out of simple curiosity, a bit of covid-19 
lockdown boredom, and wanting to brighten up my house with some extra paintings.

The fun part of this project is exploring how the different steps in the process 
affect the results. There a large number of small decisions and parts of the 
 process that have a large impact - 
from the choice of template photos, to changes in the digitial painting 
software, or the selection of brush sizes and paint textures.

I will be updating this website with content as new paintings are completed or 
new and interesting breakthroughs are made on the painting method.

*Hope you enjoy :)*
